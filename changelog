  Created the first Unity layout for the game to my branch for the project.
  The first layout includes:
    - a built Grid and several Tilemaps for it
    - set up all the folders for assets
    - imported an asset pack to use for visual reference temperarily until our art is in 
    - created the simple movement script (before modifying it to Command Pattern)
